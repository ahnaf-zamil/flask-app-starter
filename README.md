# Flask Application Starter

This is a Flask app codebase that I've set up for every single Flask app I will be making will be bootstrapped
using this repository. This is just to save up time and not initialise the codebase every single time.

## Modules included
- Flask
- Flask SQLAlchemy (DB ORM)
- Flask Migrate (for DB migrations)
- Flask CORS (for making APIs)
- Psycopg2 Binary (For PostgreSQL)
- Python dotenv (for loading .env files)
